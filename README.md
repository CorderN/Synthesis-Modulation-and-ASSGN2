# Synthesis-and-Modulation

The next assignment is to make a short piece using a library of at least 8 of your own SynthDefs,
using Patterns and/or Pdefs that use the SynthDefs as their \instrument.  This piece is due on gitHub
and played in class on Feb. 14 (Valentine's Day!)  

To start preparing your SynthDef library, this week you should delve into modulation, using the principles
shown in the tutorials 3.1 and 3.2 to try to implement any to all of the FM algorithms shown in the mod_diagrams
folder.  These are classic FM algorithms that you can implement in many different ways, using any 
Ugen oscillators you like (not restricted to sinewaves).  Upload some examples for us to share in 
class on Feb. 7.
